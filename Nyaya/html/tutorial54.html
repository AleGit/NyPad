        <p>In a binary decision tree every decision node has no (the “root”)
        or one incoming edge.
        Every decision node has exactly two (binary) outgoing edges.
        The result nodes 0 or 1 has one or no incoming edge and no outgoing edge.
        When we allow multiple incoming edges we get binary decision diagrams.</p>
        
        
        
        <h4>Ordered BDD</h4>
        
     <p>A binary decision diagram is ordered if every path has the same order of decisions.
        The binary decision diagram on the right is unordered, because the path
        (x=0,y=0,z=1) has an other decision order than the path
        (x=1,z=0,y=0). Both paths start with x,
        but on y is before z, and the other after z.
        </p>

        <p>A node in the a binary decision diagram is reducable
        if both decisions lead to the same result.</p>
