        <h4>Compositions</h4>
        
        <p>Complex statements can be build from simple propositions. We already formalized</p>
        
        
        <blockquote>If the train arrives late and there are no taxis at the station, then John is late for his meeting.
            John is not late for his meeting.
            The train did arrive late.
            <i>Therefore</i>, there were taxis a the station.
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>to</p>
        
         <blockquote>If <code>p</code> and not <code>q</code>, then <code>r</code>. Not <code>r</code>. <code>p</code>. <i>Therefore</i>,&nbsp;<code>q</code>.</blockquote>
        
        <p>As sequence of sentences has the same meaning as a enumeration of statements. So we can refine our informal model.</p>
        
        <blockquote><i>IF</i> (If <code>p</code> and not <code>q</code>, then <code>r</code>) AND (Not <code>r</code>) AND (<code>p</code>) <i>THEN</i> <code>q</code>.</blockquote>
        
        
        
        
        <table class="right">
            <tr>
                <th>connective</th><th>meaning</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>¬</td><td>not</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>∨</td><td>or</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>∧</td><td>and</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>→</td><td>if … then</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <h4>Symbols</h4>
        
        <p>By using the symbols from the table on the right wie get a propositional formula.</p>
        
        <blockquote>(<code>p</code> ∧ ¬<code>q</code> → <code>r</code>) ∧ (¬ <code>r</code>) ∧ (<code>p</code>) → &nbsp;<code>q</code></blockquote>
        
        <p>We have to recall that the modelling of statements in natural language is not part of propositional logic.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Hidden compostions</h4>
        
        <p>To “translate“ natural sentences into atoms or compositions is not always unambiguous.
        You can treat “Elephants are big, grey animals“ as one simple sentence,
        and represent it with <cite>“p”</cite> (an atom).
        Or you can decompose it to “Elephants are big and elephants are grey and elephants are animals”
        which can be modelled as <cite>“p and q and r”</cite> (an composite).
        This decomposition of sentences in natural language is part of the modelling process and can be very hard.
