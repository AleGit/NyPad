        <h3>Limits of Propositional Logic</h3>
        
        <p>Propositional logic hat limits. But it is not easy to argue,
        why propositional logic can not be used for a specific situation,
        when our guts tell us the opposite.</p>
        
        <h4>All men are mortal</h4>
        
        <p>Check the composite sentence:
        
        <blockquote>All men are mortal. Sokrates was a man. <i>Therefore</i>, Sokrates was mortal.</blockquote>
        
        <p>This feels right, but from the structure we have no argument, because the structure</p>
        
        <blockquote>p. q. <i>Therefore</i> r.</blockquote>
        
        <p>does not hold in all situations:</p>
        
        <blockquote>The sky is blue. The sea is green. <i>Therefore</i>, I am late.</blockquote>
        
        <p>Of course we can try to rewrite, but which argument do we have to do that? And can it be done in all situations? Did we do it correctly?</p>
        
        <blockquote>If man than mortal. If sokrates than man. Sokrates. <i>Therefore</i>, mortal.<br />
            If sky than blue. If sea than green. Me. <i>Therefore</i>, late.
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Which leads to two different structures.</p>
        
        <blockquote>If p than q. If s than p. s. <i>Therefore</i> q. • If p than q. If s than r. s. <i>Therefore</i> t.</blockquote>
