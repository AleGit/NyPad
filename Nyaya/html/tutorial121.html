        <p>In the first tutorial we identified the propositions of two different statements and discovered that the statements have the same structure.</p>
               
        <blockquote>If <code>p</code> and not <code>q</code>, then <code>r</code>. Not <code>r</code>. <code>p</code>. <i>Therefore</i>,&nbsp;<code>q</code>.</blockquote>
        

        
        <p>This paragraph is build from compositions of propositions and connectives.
        In propositional logic a set of symbols is used to represent these connectives.</p>
        
        <h4>Patterns</h4>
        
        <p>We do not define the point “.“ as connective. Instead we replace occurences of “.“ with “and”.
        For example “The sky is blue. The sea is green.” has the same meaning as “(The sky is blue) and (The sea is green)”.
        Further we replace “… therefore …” with “if … then …”. “I am hungry. Therefore, I eat.” corresponds to “If I am hungry then I eat.”.</p>
        
        <table class="right">
            <tr><td>composite</td><td>formula</td><td>symbol</td>
            <tr>
                <td>If <code>p</code> and not <code>q</code>, then <code>r</code>.</td>
                <td>p ∧ q → r</td>
                <td>P</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Not <code>r</td>
                <td>¬r</td>
                <td>Q</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>P. Q. p. Therefore q.</td>
                <td>P ∧ Q ∧ p → q.</td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        
        <p>By using the patterns from above and the symbols from the table we further formalize the sentence from the first tutorial to a well formed propositional formula.</p>
        
        <blockquote>(<code>p</code> ∧ ¬<code>q</code> → <code>r</code>) ∧ (¬ <code>r</code>) ∧ (<code>p</code>) → &nbsp;<code>q</code></blockquote>

        <div class="rbox" style="width:300px">
        <p>To “translate“ natural sentences into atoms or compositions is often ambiguous.
        You can treat “Elephants are big, grey animals“ correctly as one simple sentence,
        and represent it with <cite>“p”</cite> (an atom) or read it as composition <cite>“p ∧ q ∧ r”</cite>
        (“Elephants are big and elephants are grey and elephants are animals”).
        </p></div>
        
        <p>In the process of modelling we have used upper case Latin letters for representing composite sentences
        and used them to build larger composite sentences or paragraphs.
        Further we have used parenthesis to emphasize the structure of the formula.</p>
