        <h3>Natural deduction (short overview)</h3>
        
        <p>We‘ve defined how well formed formula looks like in propositional logic.
        But we still can‘t proove anything, we still can‘t infer anything from a formula.
        Natural deduction is a collection of <em>proof rules</em>,
        which can be used to proof the validity of sequents.
        
        <h3>Basic rules</h3>
        
        <p>We write down basic rules as valid sequents, which we don‘t have to proove anymore.</p>
