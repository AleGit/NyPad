        <h3>Propositions</h3>
        
        <p>The basic building blocks of propositional logic are simple propostions – 
        declarative sentences without connectives like “if … then”, “therefore“, “and”, “or”, “not”.
        These building blocks are called atoms, because like atoms in chemestry,
        propositions are indecomposable in propositional logic.</p>
        
        <p>We will use small latin letters “… p, q, r, …” to represent atoms of propositional logic.<p>
        
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The sum of two and five is seven.</li>
            <li>The team won it's seventh game this year.</li>
            <li>The sun will shine tommorow.</li>
            <li>He reached the bus.</li>
            <li>I took a taxi.</li>
            <li>She is late to the meeting.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>These sentences are declarative, because they can be checked to be true or false.
        This checking is not part of propositional logic.
        You have to use other tools (mathematics, observation, physics, guessing, …) to decide if a proposition is true.
        For example you have to look at a minimum of three fields at the tic-tac-toe-table to judge who is the winner.
        </p>
        
        
        <h4>Counterexamples</h4>
        
        <p>Not all sentences in natural languages are propositions.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>What's the sum of three and eight?</li>
            <li>Did the team win a game this year?</li>
            <li>Live long an prosper!</li>
            <li>Read the instructions!</li>
            <li>Why did you do that?</li>
            <li>Don't panic!</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Opinions are expressed in declarative sentences, but in many cases they can‘t be checked, so they are not very suitable to be modelled as atoms of propositional logic.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Tom is cooler than Jerry.</li>
        </ul>
