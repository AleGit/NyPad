        <h3>Propositions as atoms</h3>
        
        <p>The basic building blocks of propositional logic are simple propostions,
        declarative sentences without connections like “if then”, “therefore“, “and”, “or”, “not”
        These building blocks are called atoms, because like atoms in chemestry,
        propositions are indivisible in propositional logic.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Simple Propositions</h4>
        
        <h4>Counterexamples</h4>
        
        <h4>Secret compostions</h4>
        
        <p>You can represent “Elephants are big, grey animals“ with one propositon <cite>“p”</cite>,
        but the sentence “Elephants are big and elephants are grey and elephants are animals”
        can be modelled as <cite>“p and q and r”</cite>. So commas act as “and” sometimes.</p>
