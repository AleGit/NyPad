        <h3>Propositions</h3>
        
        <p>The basic building blocks of propositional logic are simple propostions,
        declarative sentences without connections like “if then”, “therefore“, “and”, “or”, “not”.
        These building blocks are called atoms, because like atoms in chemestry,
        propositions are indecomposable in propositional logic.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The sum of two and five is seven.</li>
            <li>The team won it's seventh game this year.</li>
            <li>The sun will shine tommorow.</li>
            <li>He reached the bus.</li>
            <li>I took a taxi.</li>
            <li>She is late to the meeting.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>These sentences are declarative, because they can be checked to be true or false.
        This checking is not part of propositional logic.
        You have to use other tools (mathematics, observation, physics) to decide.
        For example you have to look at a minimum of three fields at the tic-tac-toe-table to judge who is the winner.
        </p>
        
        
        <h4>Counterexamples</h4>
        
        <p>Not all sentences in natural languages are propositions.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>What's the sum of three and eight?</li>
            <li>Did the team win a game this year?</li>
            <li>Life long an prosper!</li>
            <li>Read the instructions!</li>
            <li>Why did you do that?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Compositions</h4>
        <p>Complex statements can be build from simple propostions.</p>
        
        <h4>Hidden compostions</h4>
        
        <p>To “translate“ natural sentences into atoms or compositions is not always unambiguous.
        You can treat “Elephants are big, grey animals“ as one simple sentence,
        and represent it with <cite>“p”</cite> (an atom).
        Or you can decompose it to “Elephants are big and elephants are grey and elephants are animals”
        which can be modelled as <cite>“p and q and r”</cite> (an composite).
        This decomposition of sentences in natural language is part of the modelling process and can be very hard.
