        <h3>Limits of Propositional Logic</h3>
        
        Propositional logic can not handle questions and instructions, but there are other limits too.
        
        <h4>All men are mortal</h4>
        
        <p>Consider the following classical theorem of logic:</p>
        
        <blockquote>All men are mortal. Sokrates was a man. <i>Therefore</i>, Sokrates was mortal.</blockquote>
        
        <p>This feels right, but in propositional logic we have no argument, because the structure</p>
        
        <blockquote>p. q. <i>Therefore</i> r.</blockquote>
        
        <p>does not hold in all situations (it is possible that I am not late):</p>
        
        <blockquote>The sky is blue. The sea is green. <i>Therefore</i>, I am late.</blockquote>
        
        <h4>Predicate Logic</h4>
        
        <table class="right">
            <tr>
                <td>∀x</td>
                <td>For all x</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td></td>
                <td>if</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>S(x)</td>
                <td>x is student</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>→</td>
                <td>then</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>∃y</td>
                <td>there is some y</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>I(y)</td>
                <td>y is instructor</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>∧</td>
                <td>and</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Y(x,y)</td>
                <td>x is younger than y</td>
            </tr>
            </table>
        
        
        
        <p>Propositional logic handles “if ... then”, “and", “or” and “not” quite well.
        But it does not reflect the finer logical statement of sentences like this:</p>
        
        <blockquote>Every student is younger than some instructor <a href="welcome.html#LICS">[LICS,93]</a></blockquote>
        
        <p>We can identify this assertion with a propositional atom <i>p</i>. To express properties (being a student, being an instructor), dependencies (younger than), and quantities (every, some) of entities, we can use predicates and quantifiers in predicate logic.</p>
        
        <!-- <blockquote>∀x S(x) → ∃y (I(x) ∧ Y(x,y)) </blockquote>-->
        <!-- 
        <h4>As time goes by</h4>
        
        <blockquote>If I press this button, I will get the print sometime – when the power did not go down before.</blockquote>-->
