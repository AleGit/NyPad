        <h4>Representations of Boolean functions</h4>
        
        <p>Propositional formulas and truth tables are different representations of Boolean functions.
        When “0” is mapped to “F” (false) and “1” is mapped to “T” (true),
        the complement finds it‘s counterpart in the logical negation,
        the product in the logical conjunction, and the sum in the logical disjunction.
        
        So every implication free propositional formula can be rewritten as Boolean expression without effort.
        A Boolean expression without exclusive or can be rewritten as propositional formula easily.</p>
        
        <p>Propositional formulas, CNFs, DNFs, truth tables and Boolean expression are often very complex representations of Boolean function.
