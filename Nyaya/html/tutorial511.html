        <h4>Representations of Boolean functions</h4>
        
        <p>Propositional formulas and truth tables are different representations of Boolean functions.
        When “0” is mapped to “F” (false) and “1” is mapped to “T” (true),
        the complement finds it‘s counterpart in the logical negation,
        the product in the logical conjunction, and the sum in the logical disjunction.
        
        So every implication free propositional formula can be rewritten as Boolean expression without effort.
        A Boolean expression without xor can be rewritten as propositional formula easily.</p>
        
        <p>Propositional formulas, CNFs, DNFs, truth tables and Boolean expressions
        are often very complex or representations of Boolean functions.
        Often validity or satisfiability are not easy to decide in these
        for propositional formulas and Boolean expressions.
        Truth tables are expensive to compute and take much storage.

        <h4>Binary Decision Trees</h4>
        
        <p>An efficient representation/definition of Boolean functions can be done with reduced ordered binary decision diagrams. We start with an arbitrary binary decision tree to define an binary function g(x,y,z) with three arguments.
        </p><p>To calculate the value of g(1,1,0) we start at the root node “x on the top”.
        Because x=1 we follow the solid line to “z“.
        Because z=0 we follow the dotted line to “y”.
        Because y=1 we follow the solid line to the result “0”.
        </p>
        
        <table class="right">
            <tr>
                <td>x</td>
                <td>1</td><td style="background-color:lightgrey">1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td>
                <td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>y</td>
                <td>1</td><td style="background-color:lightgrey">1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td>
                <td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>z</td>
                <td>1</td><td style="background-color:lightgrey">0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td>
                <td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td>

            <tr>
                <td>g(x,y,z)</td>

        <p>We make the following observations</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The leftmost decision node “x” seams unnessessary,
        because we can only reach this node if x=0.
        So we must go to the leftmost “0” and can't
        go to the leftmost “1”.
        If we remove the leftmost 1 and replace leftmost “x” with “0“,
        the same Boolean function is defined.</li>
        
            <li>The function is satisfiable. (There is at least one real path to 1)</li>
            <li>The function is not valid. (There is at least one real path to 0)</li>
        <li>If x=0 the the result does not depende on z.</li>
            <li>If x=1 and z=1 the result does not depend on y.</li>
            
        
        </ul>
