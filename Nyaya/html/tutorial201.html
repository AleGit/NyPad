        <p>To avoid amibuities we use parenthis in the formal grammer for propositional formulas.</p>
        
        <blockquote>P &nbsp;::=&nbsp; p &nbsp;|&nbsp; (¬P) &nbsp;|&nbsp; (P ∧ P) &nbsp;|&nbsp; (P ∨ P) &nbsp;|&nbsp; (P → P)</blockquote>
        
        A propositional formula ‘P’ (on the left side) is defined ‘::=’ through the expression on the right side.
        The expression of the right side consists of serveral parts, devided by ‘|’, which means or.
        So ‘P’ is either and atom ‘p’, or
        the negation of a formula ‘(¬P)’, or
        the conjunction of two formuals ‘(P ∧ P)’, or
         the disjunction of two formuals ‘(P ∨ P)’, or
         the implication of two formuals ‘(P → P)’.</p>
        
        
        <p>A formal grammar (sometimes simply called a grammar) is a set of formation rules for strings in a formal language. The rules describe how to form strings from the language's alphabet that are valid according to the language's syntax. A grammar does not describe the meaning of the strings or what can be done with them in whatever context – only their form.</p>
