\begin{verse}
If wishes were horses \\
Beggars would ride: \\
If turnips were watches \\
I would wear one by my side. \\
And if if's and an's were pots and pans, \\
The tinker would never work!
\end{verse}.

This nursery rhyme from the 16th century has some propositions! But are they true? 
Propositional logic provides a toolset to model this question and many other questions
where propositions are made and connected. 
\Nyaya for iPad
will introduce the formalism of propositional logic interactively.
A series of tutorials will put the user in a position
to formalize this poem
and to assess if the implications made by this poem can be true.
