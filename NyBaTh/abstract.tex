\begin{verse}
If wishes were horses \\
Beggars would ride: \\
If turnips were watches \\
I would wear one by my side. \\
And if if's and an's were pots and pans, \\
The tinker would never work!
\end{verse}.

This nursery rhyme from the 16th century has some propositions! But are they true? 
Propositional logic provides a toolset to answer this question and many other questions,
where propositions are made and connected. {\bf Ny$\bar{a}$ya for iPad} 
will introduce the formalism of propositional logic interactively, 
step by step to the user in a series of tutorials, 
so they can translate the poem into a formula of propositional logic. 
Then they will know, if the poem can be true.
