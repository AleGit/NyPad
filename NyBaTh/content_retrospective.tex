\section{Retrospective}

After years of development of administrative tools for a payment system on the .NET platform, 
the software project Ny$\bar{a}$ya for iPad was a welcome diversion.
Coping an entire different platform and mastering the restrictions in memory and cpu speed of an origional iPad were
exciting tasks. 

\section{Outlook}

\begin{itemize}

\item Internationalization and localization

\item Graphical overhaul

\item iPhone and iPod touch

\item Mac OS X

\item Android

\end{itemize}
