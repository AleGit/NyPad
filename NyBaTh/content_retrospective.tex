The first version of Ny$\bar{a}$ya is a fully functional eLearning App, 
which covers it’s purpose well.
But it is still far from perfect.
Some features have to be re-engineered before additional features can be implemented.

\section{Important improvements}

Although some technical aspects of Ny$\bar{a}$ya are working correctly, they need a revision, 
because they are too inflexible or too slow.

\begin{itemize}

\item At this time content updates can only be done with an application update in the App Store,
which will lead to some delay in the distribution of the correction of typing errors. 

\item Syntax trees are stored memory optimized as acyclic syntax diagrams. 
Nevertheless the valuation does not use this fact and the same sub-tree will be evaluated multiple times.

\item The creation of binary decision diagrams is very slow for formulas with more than 15 different atoms.

\end{itemize}

Some aspects of Ny$\bar{a}$ya’s user interface does not use the full richness of Cocoa touch. 
Others lack the graphical sophistication that users are accustomed on the iOS platform.

\begin{itemize}

\item Accessibility features of iOS have to be supported – especially 
\verb+VoiceOver+, \verb+Zoom+, \verb+LargeText+ and \verb+AssistiveTouch+.

\item Although English is the technical language of computer science,
a translation of the tutorials into as many languages as possible will increase the practical value of Ny$\bar{a}$ya.
Ny$\bar{a}$ya should support English, Spanish, German, French, Italian, Czech, Slovakian, Hungarian, Croatian, Slovenian, Romanian and Turkish
until the end of 2013.

\item Content and user interface should be presented in a visually more appealing manner.
For the first css-definitions should be developed, for the second additional images have to be created.

\section{Outlook}

To broaden the scope of Ny$\bar{a}$ya new features could be added or the application could brought to other platforms.

\subsection{Additional features}

Even it is unlikely the following features will be implemented in the foreseeable future, 
the following use cases are obvious evolutions.

\begin{itemize}

\item Creation and editing of arbitrary binary decision diagrams similar to abstract syntax trees.

\item Definition of arbitrary Boolean functions with truth tables, propositional formulas, abstract syntax trees or binary decision diagrams.

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Additional platforms}

The author of Ny$\bar{a}$a is an apologist of native client applications,
although he admits that they are many useful use cases for web-applications, 
i.e. html with javascript. 
Unfortunately the freely available development tool chains for (graphical) html/javascript-applications
are very limited and far from consolidated, although the underlining standards html-5, css-3 
and JavaScript 1.8 would provide anything needed, the workload to create sophisticated web-apps 
is much higher than to develop native apps on the same level.

So the most likely platforms to be supported by Ny$\bar{a}$ya are Mac OS X and Android.

\begin{itemize}
\item
For a Mac OS X version some aspects of the user interface must be re-thought and re-implemented, 
because Mac OS X does not support a touch interface.
\item
For an Android version the model must be translated into Java and the user interface must be re-implemented.
\end{itemize}
