Welcome to the final presentation of my bachelor and software project

Nyaya for iPad

an interactive learning environment with Bool+Tool.

My name is Alexander Maringele, and my supervisor is Georg Moser
of the Computational Logic Research Group.

What is the origin and meaning of nyaya.

Nyaya is a sanskrit word, and means literally "recurison", 
used in the sense of syllogism or inferenc or simpyl logic.

Nyaya is the name of one of the ortohodox schools of Hindu philosophy,
specifically the school of logic.

One of the tenet of this school is that "Obtaining valid knowledge is the only
way to obtain release from suffering." 

To obtain valid knowledge is an objective of modern logic  too.
This is true for the core of all logic, propostional logic.

For example we can model the nursery rhyme from the 16th centurey

An the rhyme is true!

BoolTool is provided by the computational logic research group.

It's a tool to ...

The aim of my project was to 
 allow the user to learn intaractivle simple facts about logic
- ..

in a self-explanatory environment

The concept for this self-explanatory environment is platform agnostic.

And it is very simple, Nyaya support the ...

For that Nyaya provides are tutorials ...
exercises
a playground
a glossary, where the user can find all the content from the tutorials.
and the functionality of bool tool,
which is very useful.

A concept is no useful without implementation. 
Therefore a platform had to be chosen.
