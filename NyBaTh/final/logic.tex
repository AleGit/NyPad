{\em “The aim of logic in computer science is to develop languages 
to model the situations we encounter as computer science professionals, 
in such way that we can reason about them formally.}” \\(Logic in Computer Science, Huth and Ryan) %\footnote{ \tiny

\begin{itemize}

\item Rhyme: {\em If wishes were horses beggars would ride.%\footnote{ \tiny
%Nursery rhyme originating in the 16th century}
}

\item Modeling: if [wishes are horses] then [beggars ride]

\item Model: $p \rightarrow q$

% \item Truth assignment: $v(p)$ = %\verb+true+

\item Valuation: $v(p \rightarrow q)$ is true, if v(p) is false or v(q) is true.

\item v(p) is not true in our domain
